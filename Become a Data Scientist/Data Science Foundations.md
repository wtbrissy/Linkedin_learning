### Different Types of Analytics 
- Predictive analytics: *what could happen*
	- Focus on **correlation**
	- Predictions that involve difficult data, e.g social media
	- Predictions that involve sophisticated models, e.g nerual network models

 Data Science without Prediction | Data Science without Prescriptive
 :---|:---|
|Clustering, counting, mapping, visualization |Predictive and descriptive work including classifying, clustering, trend analysis, anomalies|

- Prescriptive analytics: *what should happen*
	- Focus on **causation**
	- **Iteration** is critical
 	- Gold Standard
		- RCT: randomized controlled trial 
		- Theoretically simple
		- Often complex in partice 
		- A/B testing is easy ([A/B split testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing))
	- Methods 
		- What-If simulations 
		- Optimization models
		- Cross-Lag correlations
		- Quasi-Experiments
 
Prediction without Data Science | Prescriptive without Data Science |
:---|:---|
Clean, quantitative data set; Common models like regression or decision tree | Experimental research with well-structured data, including A/B experiments |
