### A Brief History 	
- The Role of Computer Science - Empowering statistics 
Solving practical problems by providing number crunching and massive storage 
- Inventions 
	- 1960s - Database management system (DBMS)
	- 1970s - Relational DBMS 
- Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 
	- 1980s - Terminology widely used in the community 
- Big Data 
	- Early 1990s - Explosion of business data 
	- 1997 - Offical start of using the term *big data*

	 *Michale Cox, David Ellsworth, 1997*
- Science - Harnessing the predictive power of data
	- Late 1990s 
	- Statistician is replaced by *data scientist*
- Analytics
	- Emphasizing statistical and quantitative analysis as well as 'predictive' modeling 
	- Mid-2000s
	
### Data Science Foundamentals 
- Big data 
	- Defines conventional ways of processing 
	- Is a relative term and moving target 
	- Machine learning 
		- Free humans and depneds on algorithms 
- Data mining 
	- Process of discovering a pattern 
	- Hypothesis: none 
	- Data sets: big data 
	- Data analytics is driven by hypothesis and intentionality 

### Big Data Analytics
- Distributed Computing 
	- Approach to break down a task into smaller pieces 
	- Philosophy: 'divide and conquer'
- Cloud Computing 
	- Platform to support distributed computing 
	- Computer hardware in data centers 
	- Software solution also necessary (e.g Hadoop & NoSQL databases)

### Enabling Technologies 
- Data Infrastruture Technologies 
	- Distributed computing and cloud computing 
	- Visualization and distributed file sharing
- Data Management Technologies 
	- Scables, reliable, and efficient ways to store, manage, and process data 
	- Unstructured vs. structured data
- Visualization Technologies 
	- Effective communication with non-experts 
	- Intuitive delivery 

### Skills 
- Required skills 
	- Data mining and analytics 
		- Classication 
			- Constructs a model with labels 
		- Clustering 
			- Reveals features distinguishing one class of data objects from the other, leading to new discoveries 
		- Classication labels are created by clustering 
	- Machine leanring 
		- Elments 
			- Model
			- Trial and error
			- Improved model 
			- Produces insights 
		- Types of learning 
			- Unsupervised
				- No training data or external feedback (Clustering)
			- Supervised 
				- Reinforced by feedback in the form of training data (Classfication)
		- Machine learning scientist 
			- Proficiency in programming languages
				- Python, C++, Java, and R
			- Text mining 
				- AWK, grep, find, and sort
			- Distributed computing 
	- Natural language processing (NLP)
	- Statistics
		- Minimum 
			- Probability
			- Correlation
			- Variables, distributions, and regression 
			- Null hypothesis significance test (NHST)
			- Confidence intervals, *t*-test, ANOVA and chi-square
		- Software
			- R, Excel, and SAS
		- Models 
			- Logistic regression
			- Support vector machies (SVMs)
			- Bayesian methods 
	- Visualization 
		- Display data at multiple levels of details 
		- Avoid disorting the data!
