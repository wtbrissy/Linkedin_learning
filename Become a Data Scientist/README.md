### Different Types of Analytics 
- Predictive analytics: *what could happen*
	- Focus on **correlation**
	- Predictions that involve difficult data, e.g social media
	- Predictions that involve sophisticated models, e.g nerual network models

 Data Science without Prediction | Data Science without Prescriptive
 :---|:---|
|Clustering, counting, mapping, visualization |Predictive and descriptive work including classifying, clustering, trend analysis, anomalies|

- Prescriptive analytics: *what should happen*
